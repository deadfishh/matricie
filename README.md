# matricie

my own version of a linear algebra library.  i have several matrix operations available, such as:
- addition/subtraction
- matrix multiplication
- scalar multiplication
- finding the determinant
- getting an adjugate
- taking the inverse (with the previous two operations)
- rref (and helper methods, such as row addition)

there is also a truth table generator, in the truth table class, and a prime factorization calculator.
